Here I will gather some useful [AutoHotKey](https://autohotkey.com/)-scripts.

### KeyMappings

This script was used heavily before I got my [ergodox ez](https://ergodox-ez.com/) where I could define quite all of the features in this script in the key mappings of the keyboard directly.
This script, until then, prooved to be extremely useful to me and still is, e.g. on occassions where I don't have my ergodox available. Mainly the <kbd>CAPSlock</kbd>-key was put to new life and boosted my productivity extremely.

The main features are mostly the following:

- Map <kbd>CAPSLock</kbd> to <kbd>Esc</kbd>
- <kbd>AltGr+CAPSLock</kbd> &rarr; <kbd>CAPSLock</kbd> on or off
- <kbd>CAPSLock</kbd> + <kbd>h</kbd>, <kbd>j</kbd>, <kbd>k</kbd>, <kbd>l</kbd> &rarr; vim-like cursor keys in every application
- <kbd>CAPSLock</kbd> + <kbd>y</kbd>, <kbd>o</kbd> &rarr; Pos1 / End aka begin and end of line
- <kbd>CAPSLock</kbd> + <kbd>u</kbd>, <kbd>i</kbd> &rarr; <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>left</kbd> / <kbd>right</kbd> aka one word to the left or right. This in combination with a pressed <kbd>Shift</kbd>-key you can quickly mark words
- <kbd>CAPSLock</kbd> + <kbd>Backspace</kbd> &rarr; <kbd>Del</kbd>
- <kbd>Win+v</kbd> &rarr; paste plain text
- <kbd>Win+h</kbd> &rarr; copy the colour of the pixel under the cursor to the clipboard
- <kbd>CAPSlock</kbd> + <kbd>Pause</kbd> &rarr; Start / stop media player. Other media player functions include stopping, volume control, previous / next track.
- Cut, copy and paste shortcuts also set on <kbd>CAPSLock</kbd> + <kbd>x</kbd>, <kbd>c</kbd> and <kbd>v</kbd>
- <kbd>CAPSLock</kbd> + <kbd>r</kbd> &rarr; <kbd>F5</kbd> (refresh / rerun in so many applications)

I commented the script mostly so it should become clear what each section does. Also I normally mention the author or the source where I got some snippet from. If I forgot someone, don't hesitate to contact me (just not for some stupid stuff: "Hey, I found the Escap-key on the keyboard before you! Gimme credit!" Yeah, right...).


The `ahkstdlib`-folder contains [Tuncay's standard library collection](https://autohotkey.com/board/topic/50834-ahk-standard-library-collection-2010-sep-gui-libs-100/page-1#entry317658) from 2010, mainly for backup purpose and / or inspiration.
